					<h2 class="w_h2">Introduction</h2>
					<p class="all_p_text">This page will cover four main areas of Network Security, Firewalls, 
					Network Access Control (NAC), Multifactor Authentication and Virtual Private Network (VPN). 
					The firewall section will cover what a firewall is and how they are used. 
					The NAC section will cover the specific use cases for network access control, and how it can be configured. 
					The MFA section will outline different technologies used for MFA and how they are used within business. 
					IoT will cover a variety of devices used within business and their security vulnerabilities. </p>

					<h2 class="w_h2">Firewalls</h2>
					<p class="all_p_text">A firewall sits between an internal network and the outside internet. It filters all traffic flowing to and from the network using security policies.</p>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>A firewall uses ports to allow traffic in and out of the network. For example, HTTP and HTTPS, for web traffic, use port numbers 80 and 443.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>An enterprise level firewall use security policies that can be configured to allow or deny specific connections between one or more IP addresses.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>There are three main types of firewalls. Hardware based, which is a physical device in the network, 
					software based which runs on a server and cloud based which is ran on a remote server.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>A VPN can be set up using a firewall that establishes a secure connection to a network. 
					This can be accessed from outside of the network, 
					for example the company PaloAlto had a VPN called Global Protect that allows businesses to gain access to their network from all around the county or world.</a>

					<h2 class="w_h2">Network Access Control (NAC)</h2>
					<p class="all_p_text">Network Access Control restricts certain users and devices from accessing information that they are not authorized to access.</p>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>NAC can be set up on a window server using Group Policy Objects (GPO) in conjunction with Active Directory (AD). 
					A group is set up within AD with either users or computers, a GPO is then set up to give or deny specific access to either files or applications.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>NAC prevents users accessing either information or applications that they are not supposed to access. 
					This is extremely useful when dealing with sensitive information, for example a company would not want all employees accessing their payroll files.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>This can also be used for external users that visit the business from time to time but do not need full access to the network. 
					They may be able to connect to a VPN using given logins, this account would then have access to necessary files or applications through security policies.</a>

					<h2 class="w_h2">Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
					<p class="all_p_text">Multifactor Authentication requires a user to verify a login using an external device such as a mobile phone. 
					This provides an extra level of authentication as apposed to just using a password.</p>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>One example of MFA is the mobile app DUO. Duo can be set up on to provide MFA on multiple different accounts 
					and requires the user to either approve or deny a login attempt. </a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>MFA is vital in a business setting to make user accounts more secure. This prevents external attackers from 
					using a password to gain access to the organisations data.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>A short string of digits can also be used to authenticate a user. For example with Microsoft Authenticator 
					the app generates a six digit code to enter after the password.</a>

					<h2 class="w_h2">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h2>
					<p class="all_p_text">A Virtual Private Network uses a secure connection between a device and a server to mask network activity over the network a device is connected to.</p>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>This can be useful for when someone is connected to a public network an may be open to attacks </a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>In a business setting to connect two offices a VPN would be used so that each office can access the others network securely. This is known as a site-to-site VPN.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>The data is encrypted end-to-end. Meaning that the data is encrypted at one side and decrypted at the other side.</a>
