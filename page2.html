					<h2 class="w_h2">Introduction</h2>
					<p class="all_p_text">This page will cover three cloud-based services and the cyber security put in place to protect the data on them. 
					The three services are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
					For IaaS the main points will be how providers usually encrypt the data and how they manage access to the service. 
					For PaaS the main points will be penetration testing and security scans. Finally for SaaS the main points will be the monitoring of data sharing and the encryption of data.</p>

					<h2 class="w_h2">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h2>
					<p class="all_p_text">IaaS is a cloud service made up of infrastructure such as networking, storage and virtualisation for businesses and individuals.</p>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>Like any online service IaaS is not impervious to data leaks or data loss and cyber-attacks.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>Some examples of IaaS include, Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>IaaS is all cloud based, that’s why it is important to only give access to the users that require it.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>One example of a cyber-attack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) which could overload the IaaS systems and cause multiple issues.</a>

					<h2 class="w_h2">Platform as a Service (PaaS) </h2>
					<p class="all_p_text">PaaS is a cloud computing platform for developing, running, and managing applications. This gets rid of the need for on-premises infrastructure which can be costly.</p>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine can also provide PaaS.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>Much like IaaS PaaS is open to data leaks or data loss and cyber-attacks.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>With PaaS being a cloud-based service the responsibility of keeping it secure falls to the provider. 
					They are likely to have a wider version of resources to both prevent and deal with attacks.</a>

					<h2 class="w_h2">Software as a Service (SaaS)</h2>
					<p class="all_p_text">SaaS is a platform for using cloud-based software over the internet, it elevates the need to have it run on a virtual machine.</p>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>SaaS is a platform for using cloud-based software over the internet, it elevates the need to have it run on a virtual machine.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>Providers of SaaS are required by law to keep their customer information safe and secure under the Data Protection Act of 2018.</a>
					<li class="ns_p_context"><a>Some SaaS providers will force user to use MFA when logging into their websites, this offers that extra level of security for their accounts.</a>
